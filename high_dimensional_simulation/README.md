### Simulation with a high-dimensional dataset
Supplementary material to the manuscript _Exploratory Mediation Analysis with Many Potential Mediators_. For questions, contact E.-J. van Kesteren (e.vankesteren1@uu.nl).

#### How to run
1. Open `high_dimensional_simulation.Rproj` in `RStudio`.
2. Open the file `hidim_simulation.R`.
3. If this is the first time running these files, you may wish to run `source("../theoretical_simulation/tools/install.R")` to install the packages and to install the remaining missing packages using `install.packages()` or `devtools::install_version`.
4. Run the whole file to run the simulation and save the results to the output folder.
5. `analysis.R` generates tables from the results of the simulations.
