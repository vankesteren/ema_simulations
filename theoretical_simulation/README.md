### Simulation from theoretical conditions
Supplementary material to the manuscript _Exploratory Mediation Analysis with Many Potential Mediators_. For questions, contact E.-J. van Kesteren (e.vankesteren1@uu.nl).

#### How to run
1. Open `theoretical_conditions.Rproj` in `RStudio`.
2. Open the file `theoretical_conditions.R`.
3. If this is the first time running these files, run `source("tools/install.R")` to install the correct versions of the packages used.
4. Press `ctrl+shift+o` or `cmd+shift+o` in `RStudio` to open the outline. This shows the four theoretical simulation conditions. Each condition can be run separately after having run the initialisation section.
5. `analysis.R` generates tables from the results of the simulations.
